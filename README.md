## Capstone 2025
## Title
### Strengths and weaknesses of in silico replication of epidemiological studies: alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam benzodiazepines treatment and patient outcome

## Overview
This capstone project is retrospective cohort study using National COVID Cohort Collaborative(N3C) as the data source.  The study aims to test the overarching hypothesis that off-target activation of GPR68, an extracellular proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptor, by the N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines, such as Lorazepam (Ativan) and Clonazepam (Klonopin), exacerbates acute lung injury triggered by viral or bacterial infection (REF: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26550826/,  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39907683/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39768215/) and worsens cancer outcomes (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37587561/).  To test this hypothesis, Stephanie chose to evaluate mortality outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were prescribed benzodiazepines—alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), or clonazepam (Klonopin)—within the 30 days window prior to COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test result. The second part of the analysis evaluate mortality outcomes among cancer patients who were chronically on benzodiazepines - alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), or clonazepam (Klonopin). The research leverages retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to assess health outcome based on medication history; in her project, we will carry out survival analysis among COVDI-19 patients and cancer patients who were treated with the N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines (Lorazepam and Clonazepam) versus other classes of benzodiazepines or no anxiolytic treatment.   

## Abstract

Benzodiazepines, widely used to manage anxiety, insomnia, and seizures, are frequently prescribed to COVID-19 patients, including those with a history of cancer. However, their impact on mortality and disease progression in these populations remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate the association between four specific benzodiazepines—alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam—and mortality outcomes in COVID-19 patients, focusing on prescriptions administered within 30 days prior to diagnosis. By examining these drugs individually rather than as a uniform class, the research seeks to uncover distinct effects on patient outcomes, particularly in cancer patients.

The study employs a retrospective analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), representing over 9 million COVID-19 positive patients. Two cohorts will be analyzed separately to simplify the investigation: one comprising all COVID-19 patients and another focusing on those with a cancer history. Advanced survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models, will assess the impact of benzodiazepine exposure on mortality and disease progression. The research hypothesizes that lorazepam, which activates the GPR68 receptor and may worsen inflammation and respiratory distress, is linked to poorer outcomes, while alprazolam, lacking this effect, may be safer.

These findings could reshape clinical practice by identifying benzodiazepines associated with increased risk, enabling clinicians to adjust treatment strategies—such as favoring alternatives or modifying dosages—for COVID-19 patients, especially those with cancer. This could enhance patient care and outcomes during the pandemic.
