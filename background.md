# Background
Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that suppress the activity of the central nervous system, helping to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. Cancer patients are often prescribed benzodiazepines to manage these issues, which may arise as a result of their disease or treatment. However, limited research has been conducted on how benzodiazepine use might influence COVID-19 and cancer outcomes and mortality.
A previous study reported differences in patient outcomes and the association between the use of different classes of benzodiazepines and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. When researchers examined the disease stage, progression, and treatment received in relation to specific benzodiazepines, they found that patients prescribed alprazolam had a lower risk of disease progression or death compared to those who did not take alprazolam. In contrast, patients prescribed lorazepam had a 3.83-fold higher risk of disease progression or death than those who did not take lorazepam.2
