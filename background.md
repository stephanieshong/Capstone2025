# Background

Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that suppress central nervous system activity, commonly prescribed to alleviate anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. These symptoms frequently affect cancer patients due to their disease or its treatment, making benzodiazepines a standard part of their care. However, emerging evidence suggests that the use of specific benzodiazepines may differentially impact patient outcomes, particularly in the context of cancer and COVID-19.

A previous study on pancreatic cancer patients highlighted significant differences in survival linked to specific benzodiazepines. Patients prescribed alprazolam (Xanax) exhibited a lower risk of disease progression or death compared to those not taking it. In contrast, lorazepam (Ativan) was associated with a 3.83-fold higher risk of disease progression or death. This variation may stem from lorazepam’s activation of the GPR68 receptor, which can intensify inflammation and respiratory distress—conditions that are especially critical in both cancer and COVID-19.

Given the increased susceptibility of COVID-19 patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly those with cancer, the influence of benzodiazepines on mortality and disease progression warrants further investigation. This study seeks to explore how specific benzodiazepines—such as alprazolam and lorazepam—affect outcomes in COVID-19 patients, with a focus on those with a cancer history, to guide safer prescribing practices during the pandemic.
