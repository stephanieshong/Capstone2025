### The diagram illustrates:

* Timeline Structure:

Starting from 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis (Day -30)
COVID-19 diagnosis as the index date (Day 0)
Follow-up period for outcome assessment
Event occurrence (death) or censoring

* Exposure Window:

The blue box represents the 30-day window prior to COVID-19 diagnosis when benzodiazepine exposure is assessed
This corresponds to your "acute exposure" timeframe mentioned in Hypothesis 1

* Drug-Specific Groups:

Color-coded boxes for the four benzodiazepines of interest (alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam)
These represent the different exposure groups being compared

* Outcome Assessment:

The gray area shows the period when survival/mortality is tracked
The red diamond marker indicates the event of interest (death)

* Study Hypothesis:

The blue banner at the top summarizes your hypothesis that N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines worsen COVID-19 outcomes
