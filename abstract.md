# Abstract

Benzodiazepines, widely used to manage anxiety, insomnia, and seizures, are frequently prescribed to COVID-19 patients, including those with a history of cancer. However, their impact on mortality and disease progression in these populations remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate the association between four specific benzodiazepines—alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam—and mortality outcomes in COVID-19 patients, focusing on prescriptions administered within 30 days prior to diagnosis. By examining these drugs individually rather than as a uniform class, the research seeks to uncover distinct effects on patient outcomes, particularly in cancer patients.

The study employs a retrospective analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), representing over 9 million COVID-19 positive patients. Two cohorts will be analyzed separately to simplify the investigation: one comprising all COVID-19 patients and another focusing on those with a cancer history. Advanced survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models, will assess the impact of benzodiazepine exposure on mortality and disease progression. The research hypothesizes that lorazepam, which activates the GPR68 receptor and may worsen inflammation and respiratory distress, is linked to poorer outcomes, while alprazolam, lacking this effect, may be safer.

These findings could reshape clinical practice by identifying benzodiazepines associated with increased risk, enabling clinicians to adjust treatment strategies—such as favoring alternatives or modifying dosages—for COVID-19 patients, especially those with cancer. This could enhance patient care and outcomes during the pandemic.


### Retrospective Observational Study, meaning analyze existing data rather than collecting new data prospectively.
*	Cohort Identification: Researchers start by identifying a group (cohort) of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, typically confirmed by PCR tests or clinical criteria. This cohort serves as the study population.
*	Exposure Definition: Benzodiazepine exposure is defined as the use of these medications within a specific time frame, such as 30 days before or during the COVID-19 infection. Exposure might be further categorized by: 
++	Type: Various classes of benzodiazepines: N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines versus others.
++ 	Duration: Short-term vs. chronic use.
* Outcome Measurement: The primary outcome is mortality, often measured as death within a set period after diagnosis (e.g., 30 days) or during hospitalization. Some studies also explore secondary outcomes like ICU admission or the need for mechanical ventilation, but mortality remains the main focus.

### statistical techniques used to account for factors that might influence the results:
•	Cox Proportional Hazards Models: These estimate the hazard ratio (HR), which reflects the risk of death over-time in benzodiazepine users compared to non-users.
•	Logistic Regression: This calculates the odds ratio (OR), showing the likelihood of mortality associated with benzodiazepine use.
•	Propensity Score Matching: This method balances the characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities) of benzodiazepine users and non-users to reduce bias.
