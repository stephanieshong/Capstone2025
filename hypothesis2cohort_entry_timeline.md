The diagram illustrates:

* Timeline Structure:

Starting from 2 years before cancer diagnosis (Year -2)
Cancer diagnosis as the index date (Day 0)
Follow-up period for outcome assessment
Event occurrence (death) or censoring


* Chronic Exposure Window:

The blue box represents the minimum 2-year chronic exposure period prior to cancer diagnosis
This corresponds to your hypothesis about "chronically exposed" patients (at least 2 years)


* Cancer Types:

Color-coded boxes for the four cancer types mentioned (pancreatic, brain, lung, and breast)
These represent potential stratification categories for your analysis


* Benzodiazepine Types:

Listed within the exposure window (alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam)
These are the N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines of interest


* Outcome Assessment:

The gray area shows the period when cancer survival/mortality is tracked
The red diamond marker indicates the event of interest (death)
