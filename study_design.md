# Retrospective Cohort Study Design

Retrospective Cohort Study
This study comprises two distinct analyses to evaluate the association between benzodiazepine exposure and mortality:

## Part 1: Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients
Objective: Assess the impact of benzodiazepine exposure on survival among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Index Date: Date of COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test result.
Inclusion Criteria: Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 (via diagnosis or positive test) who received alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, or clonazepam within 30 days prior to the index date.
Control Group: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with no exposure to any benzodiazepines within 30 days prior to the index date.

## Part 2: Patients with a History of Cancer
Objective: Evaluate the effect of benzodiazepine exposure on survival in patients with a history of cancer.
Index Date: Date of cancer diagnosis (or another relevant date, e.g., start of treatment, to be specified based on the research question).
Inclusion Criteria: Patients with a documented history of cancer who received alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, or clonazepam within 30 days prior to the index date.
Control Group: Patients with a history of cancer and no exposure to any benzodiazepines within 30 days prior to the index date.

### Common Design Elements
Event of Interest: Death.
Censoring: Loss to follow-up, last date of encounter, or end of study period.
Time Scale: Days from the index date.
Primary Exposure: Use of alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, or clonazepam within 30 days prior to the index date.
Outcome: Time to death, with censoring as specified above.

### Analysis Methods
Primary Analysis: Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for:
Part 1: Age, sex, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity.
Part 2: Age, sex, comorbidities, cancer stage, and type (stratified by pancreatic, brain, lung, and breast cancers if sample size permits).
Clustering Adjustment: Mixed-effects Cox model to account for hospital-level clustering.
Visual Comparison: Kaplan-Meier curves to compare survival across benzodiazepine types.
Statistical Tests: Log-rank test for overall survival differences among exposure groups.

### Sensitivity Analyses:
Competing risks analysis (e.g., using Fine-Gray models).
Restricted mean survival time (RMST) as an alternative survival metric.
Varying exposure windows (e.g., 15 or 60 days prior to the index date).

### Data Management
Data Cleaning
Standardize date formats and drug codes using OMOP concept sets.
Validate cancer diagnosis codes and COVID-19 diagnosis/test results.
Ensure accurate exposure windows (within 30 days prior to the index date).
Check follow-up completeness and eliminate implausible values.

### Missing Data Strategy
Missing at Random (MAR): Apply multiple imputation using available covariates (e.g., age, demographics).
Missing Not at Random (MNAR): Conduct sensitivity analyses under varying assumptions about missingness mechanisms to assess result robustness.

### Statistical Considerations
Power Analysis: Calculate sample size requirements for subgroup analyses (e.g., cancer types), assuming a significance level of 0.05 and desired power (e.g., 80%).
Proportional Hazards Assumption: Test using Schoenfeld residuals; consider time-varying covariates if violated.
Competing Risks: Account for non-death events (e.g., discharge or recovery) that may preclude the outcome of interest.
Sensitivity Analysis: Explore different exposure time windows to ensure findings are robust.

### Data Quality Control
Validate death dates against other clinical events.
Verify temporal relationships (e.g., no future dates relative to the index date).
Confirm drug exposure within the 30-day window prior to the index date.
Check for concurrent prescriptions or treatment changes that may confound exposure classification.
Validate medication dosing where data are available.
