# Retrospective Cohort Study Design

Phenotype 1: Hospitalized patient with COVID19-dx or positive test results and exposure to benzodiazepine 
Phenotype 2: Patient with history of Cancer and exposure to benzodiazepine
Part 1: Survival analysis and benzodiazepine exposure outcome among hospitalized COVID-19 cohort. 
Part 2: Survival analysis and benzodiazepine exposure outcome among patient with history of cancer.
To ensure the reliability of its findings, the study likely adjusts for key confounding variables, such as age, comorbidities, and cancer type. This methodological strength is crucial for isolating the specific effects of benzodiazepine use on mortality and disease outcomes, making the results more trustworthy and applicable to real-world scenarios.

•	Study Design Elements 
•	Index Date: (or time of origin) Patient with COVID-19 positive test results or COVID-19 diagnosis 
•	Inclusion criteria – Hospitalized COVID-19 dx or positive test results and drug exposure to alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam
•	Event of interest: Death
•	Censoring: Loss to follow-up or last date of encounter or end of study period
•	Time scale: days from index date
•	Primary medication exposure 30 days prior to index date: four benzodiazepine types, alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam
•	Outcome: Death, with censoring at loss to follow-up or study end.

•	Control1: 
Hospitalized COVID-19 dx and no exposure to any of the benzodiazepine medication 
•	Control2: 
Patients with history of cancer and no exposure to any type of benzodiazepine medications
Note to Self:assuming a significance level of 0.05, the sample size for estimating a proportion is n = z2pq/d2
If you want to test whether an exposure to the given drug changes time to mortality event (without specifying whether it increases or decreases it.
 
•	Analysis Method
•	Selected individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 dx or positive test result who had exposure to following four types of benzodiazepine within last 30 days of index date.
•	Quantify receipt of alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam use of benzodiazepine types 30 prior to the hospitalization 
•	Logistic regression models determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) at the hospital level, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. 
•	Employ advanced survival analysis techniques, such as Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. These methods are considered the gold standard for studying time-to-event outcomes like mortality. This rigorous approach allows the researchers to assess not only whether benzodiazepine exposure affects survival but also how it influences the timing and likelihood of death, providing a detailed picture of disease progression in these patients.

•	Primary Analysis
•	Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for confounders
Cox model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and COVID severity
 part 2: cancer stage, stratified by cancer type if sample size permits. 
•	Mixed-effects Cox model for hospital clustering. 
•	Kaplan-Meier Curves for visual comparison among the drug types
Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and sensitivity analyses (competing risks, RMST). 
•	Multiple imputation tailored to survival data.
•	Log-rank test for overall comparison
•	Primary model: survival time benzotype and covariates
•	Part 2: Stratification by cancer types (pancreatic, brain, lung and breast)
•	Data Cleaning steps
•	Ensure consistent data format – OMOP date and datetime fields
•	Standardized drug names / codes – Utilize concept sets for alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam and COVID-19 dx and positive test results
•	Validate cancer dx codes – concept set
•	Create proper time window for benzodiazepine drug exposure – within 30 days prior to the COVID-19 dx or positive test results. 
•	Check follow-up completeness***

•	Missing Data Strategy 
•	Multiple imputation for MAR
Multiple imputation for MAR (Missing At Random) data is a statistical technique used to handle missing data in a way that makes use of all available information. It helps improve the accuracy of inferences when dealing with incomplete datasets.
Note that the missingness can be predicted based on known information, like age and demographics, but not based on the actual values of the missing data.

•	Sensitivity analysis for MNAR (Missing Not At Random) data Analysis:
Sensitivity analysis for MNAR (Missing Not At Random) data Analysis
refers to a method used to explore how the results of an analysis might change under different assumptions about the missing data. In the context of MNAR data, sensitivity analysis involves testing how robust the conclusions are to different assumptions about the nature of the missing data. Since MNAR data can't be handled with simple methods (like multiple imputation for MAR), researchers conduct sensitivity analyses by considering a range of assumptions for the missingness mechanism and examining how these assumptions affect the results.
•	Statistical Consideration
•	Power analysis for the subgroup analysis
•	Assessment of proportional Hazards assumption
•	Handling of the competing risks
•	Sensitivity analysis for different time windows

•	Data quality control measures and validation 
•	Validate death dates against other events
•	Check for implausible dates and values
•	Verify temporal relationships
•	Ensure there is no future dates
•	Confirm drug exposure window
•	Check for concurrent prescriptions
•	Validate medication dosing information
•	Account for treatment changes
