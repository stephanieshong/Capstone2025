## Hypothesis 1:  
Patients who were acutely (within past 30 days of infection) exposed to N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines, which activate GPR68, would have worsening of acute lung injury caused by COVID-19. 

## Hypothesis 2: Patients who were chronically (at least 2 years prior to infection) exposed N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines would have worse cancer outcomes.
