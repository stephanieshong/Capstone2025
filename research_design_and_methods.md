# Research Design and Methods

We propose a retrospective analysis using data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a comprehensive repository managed by NIH/NCATS. The N3C dataset integrates Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, linked mortality records (from third-party obituary sources), cancer registry data (from SEER), and insurance claims (from CMS). As of February 2025, this publicly accessible resource, available through a Data Use Agreement, includes data from over 23.5 million patients across 86 health systems, with more than 9 million COVID-19 positive cases.

## Our study aims to:

Replicate findings that lorazepam (Ativan), but not alprazolam (Xanax), is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cancer progression, and mortality.
Examine prognosis by assessing whether lorazepam use, unlike alprazolam, correlates with worse outcomes following a COVID-19 diagnosis.
Investigate healthcare utilization by analyzing the association between mortality outcomes and emergency room visits or hospitalizations.
Characterize mortality rates for specific cancer types—pancreatic, brain, lung, and breast cancer—in relation to benzodiazepine use.
We will employ advanced survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. These gold-standard methods for time-to-event outcomes will enable a rigorous assessment of how benzodiazepine exposure influences survival, mortality timing, and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with a cancer history. This approach ensures reproducibility and a detailed understanding of the study’s findings.

## Retrospective Cohort Study Design

These studies are retrospective, meaning they analyze existing data rather than collecting new data prospectively.
*	Cohort Identification: Researchers start by identifying a group (cohort) of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, typically confirmed by PCR tests or clinical criteria. This cohort serves as the study population.
*	Exposure Definition: Benzodiazepine exposure is defined as the use of these medications within a specific time frame, such as 30 days before or during the COVID-19 infection. Exposure might be further categorized by: 
+	Type: Various classes of benzodiazepines: N-unsubstituted benzodiazepines versus others.
+	Duration: Short-term vs. chronic use.
*	Outcome Measurement: The primary outcome is mortality, often measured as death within a set period after diagnosis (e.g., 30 days) or during hospitalization. Some studies also explore secondary outcomes like ICU admission or the need for mechanical ventilation, but mortality remains the main focus.
